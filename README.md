## Description

This p5.js project is an interactive story game that demonstrates game state management and decision-tree branching. The player explores a magical forest, making choices across 3 scenes that affect their score. The game features multiple endings determined by the player's accumulated points, showcasing how to track player data across scenes and implement conditional outcomes.

The project includes a start screen, 3 story scenes with branching choices, and 2 different endings (good/bad) based on the player's score.
